# ft_printf
School 21 (Ecole 42) project: self-made printf() function. \
It can manage the following conversions: d, i, o, u, x, X, c, s, p, f, %. For better understanding of interconnections inside printf() I created [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gkbZL_Y1xvxkVb7JJvvkYqlOA_BIJ_mOJ0tdKzfCzWU/edit?usp=sharing).
